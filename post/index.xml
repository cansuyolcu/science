      <description>Project_Time_Series In this project I&amp;rsquo;ll be developing time series forecasting models to predict future product prices using Facebook Prophet.
Some information about the dataset are:
 almost a million observation 1115 unique stores Note that sales is the target variable (that&amp;rsquo;s what we are trying to predict) Id: transaction ID (combination of Store and date) Store: unique store Id Sales: sales/day, this is the target variable Customers: number of customers on a given day Open: Boolean to say whether a store is open or closed (0 = closed, 1 = open) Promo: describes if store is running a promo on that day or not StateHoliday: indicate which state holiday (a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None) SchoolHoliday: indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools    Github link to this project</description>

      <description>I will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle.
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off),I will build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan.</description>

      <description>In this NLP project I will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.
I will be using Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle.
Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.
The &amp;ldquo;stars&amp;rdquo; column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business.</description>

      <description>For this project I will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public. It is very important to note, I actually have the labels for this data set, but I will NOT use them for the KMeans clustering algorithm, since that is an unsupervised learning algorithm. I will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed.</description>

      <description>I will be analyzing the famous iris data set using support vector machines. The Iris flower data set or Fisher&amp;rsquo;s Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.</description>

      <description>For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. I use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
Here are what the columns represent:
 credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise. purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values &amp;ldquo;credit_card&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;debt_consolidation&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;educational&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;major_purchase&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;small_business&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;all_other&amp;rdquo;).</description>
